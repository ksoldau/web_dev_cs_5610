<h3>More jQuery thoughts</h3>
<p>I've been doing some more jQuery experiments. While I've been doing them I've been wondering how hard it will ultimately be to style them. I can't tell if it will be hard to give it my own kind of style, or if it will have to stay very similar to the default theme of jQuery. It seems like it would take a bit of effort/time to style it myself.</p>

<p>I'm also a bit confused about exactly which files from jQuery UI need to be included in my site. I definitely don't need all of the things that came with the download, but I can't uet figure out exactly what I can take out and what stuff has to stay. As I do more jQuery experiments and research a bit more I'm sure I'll figure it out though.</p>

<p>I'm starting to realize just how much you can do with jQuery. The fact that you can do so much with jQuery is both exciting and terrifying. It seems like there are hundreds of variations (if not thousands) in ways you can set up and initialize a dialog box. I worry that I'll miss out on learning that a possibility to do something exists just because I'll overlook something on accident. However, that's kind of cool because that means there's so many possibilities!</p>
