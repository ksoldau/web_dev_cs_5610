<h3>jQuery experiment</h3>
<p>I worked on doing a sortable list for a jQuery experiment today. I looked on the jQUery UI website to see how to do it, then did it myself and styled it a tiny bit. I think this could be useful for a user to use if they need to sort their favorite songs in their profile. Other than that I'm not entirely sure where this could come in handy on my site, but time will tell. It was a lot easier than I thought it would be to implement the sorted list</p>
