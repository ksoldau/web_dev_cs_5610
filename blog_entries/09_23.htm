<h3>My first blog post!</h3>
<h4>Some snippets of things I've been thinking about so far.</h4>

<p>So far I've done some work in sprucing up my homepage using HTML and CSS. I've also done some experiments with CSS and jQuery. For my CSS experiments I actually wrote the CSS in Sass so that I could learn that and get a bit of a handle on it. For my first CSS experiments I put a lot of different types of experiments in one page. I realized that wasn't that helpful to look back on once I've learned from it, so I've done seperate pages for each experiment since. For the jQuery experiments I'm trying to figure out what would be helpful to know how to do once I start on my project site. Since I'm going to make a ukulele tabs/chord listing site I thought it would be helpful to figure out how to have users rate something based on shapes that highlight (like the five star system) and also to have an autocomplete function in the search bar so they can more easily find what they are searching for.</p>



<p>For my project I'm going to build a site that has chord listings and tabs for the ukulele. I've always wanted a site like this that was easily usable, so I'm going to create one. Users will be able to upload tabs and then anyone can see them. They will also be able to rate tabs and to favorite them. The tabs/chord listings will be searchable by song title, artist, and album. I also need to think of a way to show songs that are like Disney songs since people might search 'Disney' to get to it, but that term might not be anywhere in the artist or album title. I have to figure out a way to deal with that.</p>

<p>An interesting thing I've learned so far is that floats do not change the vertical position of the object. I feel like that's something that I should have figured out by now, but reading that cleared up a lot of my confusion with floats. Cool!</p>
