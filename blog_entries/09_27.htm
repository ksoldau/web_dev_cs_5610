<h3>Documentation!</h3>
<p>I somehow had missed the whole idea that our experiments had to be documented in a specific way, so I'll have to fix up the documentation for my experiments sometime soon. However, I can't do it before tonight at 9 PM because I simply don't have the timd to do so. I think documenting everything will be extremely useful and makes sense, but it somehow escaped my mind. So, next time!</p>

<p>I went to Professor Annunziato's office hours today to ask about documentation. Now I really understand what we need to do so when I go to redo the documentation on my old experiments or to start the documentation on any new ones I'll know what's going on!</p>
